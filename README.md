--------------------
## Background
This project tests different machine learning algorithms to find the optimal algorithm to predict machine failures for a large company that produces machine fabricated parts. The dataset used to train the models is synthetically generated and can be found at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e17/data), it is based on this [Machine Failure Predictions dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dineshmanikanta/machine-failure-predictions). 

## Preprocessing the Data
* The csv files of the dataset were placed in s3 buckets on AWS
* The `id` columns were dropped from both the training and the testing datasets
* The target array was created using the `Machine Failures` column
* The Features contains the remainder of the variables
* To test the models locally, the training set was split into testing and training sets using `sklearn` 

## Models and Their Performance

### Logistic Regression

#### Additional Data Preprocessing
* The testing and training sets were concatenated into a dataframe so that one-hot encoding could be implemented, using the `pd.get_dummies()` function
* The categorically encoded datasets were then split again into their respective training and testing sets
* The training and testing sets were scaled using `StandardScaler()`

#### Time to Run
12.5 seconds

### Random Forest

#### Additional Data Preprocessing
* The `Product ID` column was dropped from the features dataframe
* One-hot encoding was used on the features dataframe
* Oversampling was done on the training set so that the set had 10% machine failures, as machine failures made up just over 1% of the original training set
  * RandomOverSampler from imblearn was used to oversample the data
#### Classification Report
Both of the classification reports, pre and post oversampling are included below:

#### Time to Run

### Gradient Boosting Classifier/Grid Search CV

#### Additional Data Preprocessing
* The testing and training sets were concatenated into a dataframe so that one-hot encoding could be implemented, using the `pd.get_dummies()` function
* The `Product ID` column was dropped from the features dataframe
* The categorically encoded datasets were then split again into their respective training and testing sets
* Oversampling was done on the training set so that the set had 50% machine failures, which were only just over 1% in the original set

#### Time to Run

173.7 seconds

### Neural Network

#### Additional Data Preprocessing
* Due to a low rate of machine failure, oversampling was done to boost the rate of machine failure to 50% of the data set.
* In order to remove the categorical data, the `Product ID` column was dropped and `LabelEncoder()` was used to transform the `Type` column into numerical data.
* The model was run with two hidden layers of 10 nodes and 3 nodes respectively, both using `relu` as their activation. The output layer had one node with the `sigmoid` output in order to make it approximate a boolean output.

## Final Model Choice and Optimization
Gradient Boosting and Random Forest were quite close in their model performace, but the gradient boosting model performed slightly better. Thus, the gradient boosting model was selected to be optimized further.

The gradient boosting model was optimized through:
* Ranging the oversampling ratio
* Ranging the max depth
* Ranging the estimators
* Ranging the learn rate
* Dropping or adding back specific columns
* Using or not one-hot encoding 
* Testing the hypertuned model via the Kaggle test dataset and scoring

## Interesting Findings

When visualizing the feature importance for the top two performing models, gradient boosting and random forest, we found that the feature importance changes depending on the model used. 

The **gradient boosting** feature importances are:

The **random forest** feature importances are:

We are unsure why this is happening, and given more time, we would like to investigate this difference between models.

## Future Work

To further optimize the gradient boosting model we would:

* Pull out less important features
* Hypertune parameters with oversampling ratio at 50/50
* Clarify definitions of features and target
* Explore features for failure conditions
* Explore relationships between features
* Using Kaggle scores to optimize the model (prevents overfitting)

Additionally, we would explore other models to see if another model would work better than those that we tried.
