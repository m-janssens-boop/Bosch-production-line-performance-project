# Project 4 Overview
For Project 4, you will work with your group to solve, analyze, or visualize a problem using machine learning (ML) with the other technologies we’ve learned. Here are the specific requirements:

Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
1. Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies we’ve learned.
2. You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.
3. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 10,000 records.
4. You must use Pandas and Matplotlib
5. You must use a database (SQL or MongoDB)
6. You must use GCP or AWS
7. You must either use Javascript (Plotly/Leaflet) OR Tableau

* Multiple models and cross validation were used (10 points)
* The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling (5 points)
    * Data contained at least 10,000 records (contact instructor/TA if you have less than 10000)
* The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark (5 points)
* <s> The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared. (5 points) <s>
